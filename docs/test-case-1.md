# Potential Test Case(s) for Use Case 1
- Tkinter has built in test case functions that can simulate clicking events so we can observe whether such clicks truly move the cursor or not.
- We can also set up a macro recording of two click events in distinct spots and set that macro to loop and again we observe whether the cursor moves correct or not.
